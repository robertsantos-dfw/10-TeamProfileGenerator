## Description 

It's very important working in teams and breaking down the project into pieces. This is also true when it comes to identifying your team members involved in the project. So, WE built a Profile Generator where you could input a team member's info given a list of questions. Dependant on the Role, the input syntax will present different questions that only pertain to the unique role.

## Installation

This application will require the installation of the following dependencies and technologies:
* node.js
* Inquirer npm package ([inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer))
* Jest ([jest](https://jestjs.io/)) 
* NPM Install

## Usage 

This application is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. After cloning, installing node and opening the package with your code editor, you simply open the file app.js in console. Make sure to change your directory to (repoName)/Develop, then type node app.js and enter. Once initiating the app, you will be provided with questions related to your team. The first question will be your general team member info and a unique question follows once you've selected the team member's role. You will be able to input various team members one after another when prompted to continue adding. After the last question is answered and no longer adding team members, a team.html file will be created automaticly in a folder named output (/develop/output/team.html).

## Tests

Ran at the root of Develop, you can type into console "npm run test". You have to make sure your console is pointed to <reponame>/develop in order for it to correctly run.

There are 4 test packages to ensure that the code defines and exports the Employee class accurately.
