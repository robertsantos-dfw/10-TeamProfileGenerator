## Description 

It's very important working in teams and breaking down the project into pieces. This is also true when it comes to identifying your team members. So, WE built a Profile Generator where you could input a team member's info given a list of questions. Dependant on the Role, the input syntax will present differnt questions that only pertain to the unique role.

## Installation

This application will require in the installation of the following dependencies and technologies:
* node.js
* Inquirer npm package [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* Jest [jest](https://jestjs.io/) 
* NPM Install

## Usage 

This application is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. After cloning, installing node and opening the package with your code editor, you simply open the file app.js in console, change your directory to (repoName)/develop, then type node app.js. After that you will be provided with questions related to your team. The first question will be your general team member info and a unique question which is dependant on the role selected. After the last question is answered, a team.html file will be created automaticly in a folder named output (/develop/output/team.html).

Ran at the root of Develop, you can type into console "npm run test". You have to make sure your console is pointed to <reponame>/develop in order for it to correctly run.

There are 4 test packages to ensure that the code to define and export the Employee class is accurate.
